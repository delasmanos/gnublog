You know how it is, you meet up for a rehearsal, chat first, build up slowly, one of you might even play a tune to check if he's "in tune"...

Unfortunately, a good rehearsal also needs a few soft rules.

Here are some soft rules which helped us not to murder somebody üòÅ:

## Communication is key

Good communication is essential for any successful band. Members should be able to express their ideas, concerns, and feedback in a respectful and constructive manner. Regular band meetings can help ensure that everyone is on the same page.

## Practice regularly  

Regular practice is essential for improving as a band. Set a regular practice schedule and stick to it as much as possible. Make sure everyone is prepared and ready to practice when it's time to start

## Be open to feedback

Be open to feedback from other band members and from outside sources, such as fans or music industry professionals. Constructive criticism can help you improve as a band and as individual musicians

## Respect each other's opinions

Everyone in the band should have a say in the creative process. Respect each other's opinions and be willing to compromise when necessary

## Set goals

Set goals for the band, such as writing new songs, booking gigs, or recording an album. Having clear goals can help keep everyone motivated and focused

## Be professional

Treat your band like a business. Be punctual, reliable, and professional in all your dealings with each other and with others in the music industry

## Have fun

Remember that playing music should be fun! Enjoy the creative process and the time you spend together as a band

## Timing

...is all and not a city in china üòè

These are just a few general rules that can help a band function effectively. Every band is different, so it's important to find what works best for your particular group.
