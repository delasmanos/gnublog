## Real Salsa recipe

**Freshness:** Homemade salsa is made with fresh ingredients, which results in a more vibrant and flavorful dip.

**Customization:** When you make your own salsa, you can adjust the ingredients to suit your taste. Like it spicy? Add more jalapenos. Prefer a sweeter salsa? Add some ripe mango.

**Healthier:** Store-bought salsas can contain preservatives and added sugars. Making your own ensures you know exactly what's going into your dip.

### Ingredients

Here's what you'll need to make your own salsa:

- 4 ripe tomatoes
- 1 red onion
- 2 jalapenos
- 1 bunch of fresh cilantro
- 2 limes
- Salt to taste

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Preparation

Start by washing all your fresh produce. Dice the tomatoes and red onion, and finely chop the jalapenos and cilantro.

#### Mixing: 

In a large bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, onion, jalapenos, and cilantro.

#### Seasoning:

Squeeze the juice of the two limes over the mixture, and add salt to taste. Stir well to combine.

#### Resting: 

Let the salsa sit for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve your homemade salsa with tortilla chips as a snack, or use it as a topping for tacos, burritos, or grilled chicken. The possibilities are endless!

## Conclusion
Making your own salsa at home is a simple and rewarding life hack. It's a fun way to experiment with flavors, and it results in a fresh and delicious dip that's perfect for sharing.
